Two teams, humans vs sentients.

New take on RTs genre: Less focus on APM and more on fun.
This means a slower pace and focus on frontline combat as Basic units are the only
units that can grab Command Points that give resources for more units.

Humans have Engineers as basic units that upgrade to Mechs, that upgrade to Tanks or another form of vehicle
Sentients have Projectors as basic units that upgrade to Pioneers, that upgrade to Hives.

With the upgrade system; another layer of slow pace and less focus on APM is added.
The players will need plenty of basic units to remain in control of the field which costs time and money
limiting the expansive potential of each player.
